vim_config.txt	Documentation for my vim configuration

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                    *vim_config*

This is my vim configuration created to suit my personal tastes and improve my
hdl workflow.  I primarily use VHDL but over time many of the VHDL features
will be expanded for verilog and systemverilog. If I'm ever feeling
particularly ambitious, some of the functions may find their way into a
separate plugin.

This configuration has been tested in gvim for Win32 and linux.

==============================================================================
FEATURES                                               *vim_config-features*

*  Template for new vhdl files with code folding
*  Abbreviations for commonly used vhdl snippets
*  Automatically updating last modified header field, revision date and
   revision time registers
*  Comment/Uncomment selection for a variety of file types.
*  Tag hdl files for fast design navigation
*  Generate Testbench template for vhdl file
*  Generate Modelsim script .do template for vhdl testbench
*  For details of all settings see the vimrc file.  I've tried to comment it
   so it is easy to read
*  Note: Modifications are required if a format is used other than that found
   in the vhdl template skeleton.vhd or if a folder structure other than the
   one listed below is used in order to support some features.

   Project folder structure:
      project/
        source/
          constraint/  	timing, placement, & pin constraints
          debug/       	chipscope & signaltap files
          hdl/	       	source files
          ip/	       	third party IP
          model/       	models for test
          tb/	       	testbench files
          tags	       	ctags created tag files
        testcase/	modelsim scripts

*  Note: Working directory should always be set to source

PLUGINS                                                 *vim_config-plugins*

	https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
	version 2.2

vip - VHDL Interface Plugin.  
	There are many built in features but I primarily use it to capture a
	vhdl entity and paste it as an instance.  I've modified this plugin as
	follows:

	1. include 'entity work.' in instance pasting to eliminate the need
	for component declaration.  This has the side effect of breaking some
	of the other features that I don't use.  

	2. when yanking an entity with ports beginning with i_, o_, or b_, the
	prefix is removed for the signal assignment.

	3. when pasting an instance, the signal width is appended as a
	comment. This only works for std_logic, and std_logic_vector.

	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3335
	version 1.2.0 - 12 Dec 2010

I'm using the colors from base16 colorscheme, but I've switched them around

TOOLS                                                     *vim_config-tools*

I use the following tools in addition to Vim:

Exuberant Ctags - Creates tags to enable quick jumps around your project.
	For example from a vhdl instance to its corresponding entity or from a
	function call to the function definition, etc.  I use this mainly for
	verilog and vhdl files but there are 41 supported programming
	languages.
		ctags.sourceforge.net

Autohotkey - Allows remapping of keyboard keys for windows without registry
	modifications.  I use this to change the behavior of the capslock key.
	If capslock is pressed and released, it sends an <Esc>.  If capslock
	is pressed and held while another character is pressed, it sends a
	<Ctrl>.

Modelsim - Industry standard hdl simulation tool.
